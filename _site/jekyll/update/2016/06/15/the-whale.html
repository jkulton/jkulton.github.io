	    	<p>Thank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.</p>

<p><em>“Sir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does.”</em></p>

<h3 id="art-not-thou-the-leg-maker-look-did-not-this-stump-come-from-thy-shop">Art not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy shop?</h3>

<p>“I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?”
“Well enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?”</p>

<p>“Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but they’ve set me now to turning it into something else.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling, monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those same coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a jack-of-all-trades.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“But I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do.”</p>

<p>“The gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin? The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in hand. Dost thou never?”
“Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I’m indifferent enough, sir, for that; but the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there was none in his spade, sir. But the caulking mallet is full of it. Hark to it.”</p>
